        <h3>Lesson 2: Fixed vs Growth Mindset</h3>
        <h4>Slide 6:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>What is a fixed mindset?</strong><br>
          The idea that your skills are predetermined from birth—that you can't change whether you're good at something or not—is known as a fixed mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is a growth mindset?</strong><br>
          A growth mindset, on the other hand, is the conviction that abilities can be acquired with work, education, and perseverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film tells the tale of László Polgár, who held the opinion that talent is something that is developed via hard work and the correct circumstances rather than something that is innate.  
          He raised his three daughters, Susan, Sophia, and Judit, to be chess champions as evidence of this.  
          All three were successful; Judit even defeated world champion Garry Kasparov to become the world's best female chess player.  
          Their accomplishments demonstrated that diligence and commitment are more important than innate ability.
        </p>
        <h4>Slide 9-11: Personal Reflection – Quiz</h4>
        <p><strong>Chosen Statements & Reflections:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>There are just some things I’ll never be good at.</em><br>
            It may be true, but I can become proficient at what I do if I maintain the discipline to concentrate on studying well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>When I make a mistake, I try to learn from it.</em><br>
            Yes, I do. I adore constructive criticism. It gives me other perspectives and ideas about how I present myself, which is helpful when I'm getting ready for a job or even when I'm handling difficult situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>I feel good when I do something others cannot.</em><br>
            Naturally, it makes me happy to be able to assist others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>It’s possible to change how intelligent you are.</em><br>
            Sure, with time and work, you may expand your knowledge and life applications, be a better person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>I enjoy taking on new unfamiliar challenges or tasks.</em><br>
            To see my development, I sometimes need to pull back from learning so that I can apply what I've learnt to real-world situations.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Results:</strong> 3 Even, 2 Odds (Growth Mindset)</p>

        <h4>Slide 13: Fixed & Growth Mindset Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal:</strong><br>
            “I have not been acing this hobby/skill, I shall look for alternative ways for quality learn/practice instead of mindlessly practicing. Maybe I will ask people around me, or research tutorials online.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relationship:</strong><br>
            “Family has many conflicts, and tends to communicate loudly and rudely. Even though I understand their frustrations, it is not the way to be acting.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Academic/Career:</strong><br>
            “I took a two-year deferment from polytechnic to explore different paths and take a short break. During that time, I pursued a private diploma in Fashion Design. Now, I’m about four years older than most of my peers. Although I’ve gained unique experiences, I recognize that my knowledge in both fashion and tech is still developing due to limited exposure and hands-on experience.”
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Slide 15: Mindset Characteristics</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, I exhibit characteristics of a growth mindset. While I do struggle with laziness and often find it difficult to stay disciplined compared to some of my peers, 
          I genuinely believe that with the right guidance, consistent effort, and a willingness to learn, I can improve and achieve my goals. 
          I don't see my weaknesses as permanent, but rather as areas I can work on over time.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Examples of Both Mindsets:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Personal:</strong><br>
            <em>Growth Mindset:</em> I’ve started picking up new habits like journaling and self-reflection. Although it takes discipline, I believe these habits will help me grow over time. 
            I also actively seek ways to improve my mindset and stay open to change.<br>
            <em>Fixed Mindset:</em> Sometimes I feel like I’m just naturally lazy or not a motivated person, which makes it harder for me to take the first step in forming positive routines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relationship:</strong><br>
            <em>Growth Mindset:</em> I’ve come to understand that communication is a skill. I make an effort to express myself more clearly and calmly, and I try to learn from past misunderstandings instead of shutting down.<br>
            <em>Fixed Mindset:</em> In the past, I used to think that if someone didn’t understand me from the start, we were just incompatible—so I would give up instead of working through the issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Academic/Career:</strong><br>
            <em>Growth Mindset:</em> I take initiative to look for resources, ask questions, and get hands-on practice when I don’t understand something. I also value constructive criticism from peers and use it to improve my work.<br>
            <em>Fixed Mindset:</em> There are times when I’ve thought, “I’ll never be as knowledgeable or quick at navigating between software, applications, and operating systems.” 
            These doubts created a barrier that made me hesitant to explore and learn effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Slide 19: Growth Mindset Class Statements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>“Challenges help me grow stronger and more capable.”</li>
          <li>“Feedback is an opportunity to get better, not a sign of failure.”</li>
          <li>“My abilities can improve over time with consistent effort and learning.”</li>
          <li>“I learn more when I step out of my comfort zone.”</li>
          <li>“Success comes from trying, learning, and not giving up.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Slide 22-24: Perspectives & Mindset Statements</h4>
        <p><strong>Slide 23:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Our viewpoints have a big impact on how we feel, think, and behave.  
          They influence our interpretation of events, influencing our feelings of excitement, anxiety, or indifference.  
          An optimistic viewpoint encourages hope and action, whereas a pessimistic one frequently results in negative thoughts and avoidance.  
          Our perspectives shape how we think about ourselves and other people, and they also determine how we behave—whether we participate, retreat, or take the initiative.  
          In the end, our viewpoint serves as a filter that influences our mental and emotional reactions and moulds our behaviour appropriately.  
          Therefore, changing our point of view can change how we see and react to the world.
        </p>

        <blockquote>“Your vision is only actionable if you say it out loud. If you keep it to yourself, it will remain a figment of your imagination.” – Simon Sinek</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Fixed Mindset Statement:</strong> "I'm not good at this, so I should just give up."</p>
        <p><strong>Growth Mindset Statement:</strong> "I’m not good at this yet, but with effort and persistence, I can improve and master it."</p>

      <div class="tab-content" id="reflection-3-ca">
        <h2>1a. Essay on What Grit and Mindsets Mean to You</h2>

        <h3>Describe the concept of grit and mind-sets and explain their significance to one’s success</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that grit is the ability to pursue long-term goals with unrelenting desire and persistence.
          Even in the face of waning motivation and impending challenges, it is the silent force that keeps up effort over months or years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internal beliefs people have about their capacity to learn, develop, and change are referred to as mindsets,
          especially the difference between a fixed and a growth mindset as defined by Carol Dweck.
          A growth mindset recognises that intelligence and skill are only beginnings and that perseverance and persistent work are necessary to reach true mastery.
        </p>
        <p>
          One cannot stress the importance of mindsets and grit in attaining achievement.
          Grit, or the will to keep going, and a growth-oriented mindset are what really define one's potential, even when talent can open doors.
          While a growth mindset encourages adaptability and the never-ending quest for knowledge in the face of failure,
          grit keeps people going when there are no instant rewards.
        </p>

        <h3>Explain the relationship between grit and mind-sets</h3>
        <p>
          These two forces are mutually reinforcing.
          Grit is naturally fostered by a growth mentality; we are more inclined to persevere through failure and setbacks when we think that abilities can be developed.
          On the other hand, gritted people frequently develop a growth mentality with experience,
          realising that hard work, not natural talent, is what really propels success.
        </p>

        <h3>Develop an individual formula/statement for success</h3>
        <p><strong>My personal formula for success is:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          “Resilience in effort, humility in learning, and faith in continuous evolution.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I believe that success is not a fixed destination but a dynamic journey shaped by persistent striving and an openness to change.
        </p>

        <h2>1b. Reflection on Key Actions to Nurture a Growth Mindset</h2>

        <h3>Assess the level of your grittiness in the three domains of your life</h3>
        <p>
          In my family life, the bond is often disorganized and emotionally inconsistent,
          which makes it difficult to rely on a strong support system.
          Despite this, I continue to strive for personal growth independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of friendships, I am still learning how to build meaningful relationships
          and understanding when to walk away from those that no longer serve my well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academically, although my grades have been subpar,
          I’ve discovered that I am far more engaged and committed when learning is hands-on.
          I lack formal certifications, but I’ve recently begun taking ownership of my professional development
          by initiating personal projects to regain momentum after a long period of stagnation.
        </p>

        <h3>Identify and commit to two personal growth areas of grittiness</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Building consistent discipline and momentum, especially during periods when the excitement of new projects fades.</li>
          <li>Developing alternative problem-solving approaches to better handle complex or unfamiliar challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identify two thinking patterns that hinder the development of your growth mindset</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Catastrophizing setbacks, often interpreting failure as a sign of inadequacy instead of a learning opportunity.</li>
          <li>Procrastinating due to perfectionism, where I delay starting tasks unless conditions feel ideal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Develop three key actions to track a commitment to a growth mindset</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weekly Reflective Journaling</strong> – Track challenges, failures, and lessons learned to reinforce progress and resilience.</li>
          <li><strong>Micro-Goal Setting and Bi-Weekly Reviews</strong> – Break down larger goals into achievable milestones and assess progress regularly to stay motivated.</li>
          <li><strong>Structured Weekly Self-Evaluation</strong> – Objectively analyze what worked, what didn’t, and how to adjust without harsh self-judgment, promoting continuous improvement.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="tab-content" id="reflection-4">
        <h2>Slide 8: Goal Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          A system called goal hierarchy aids in dividing big, long-term goals into more achievable, smaller tasks.
          It starts with high-level objectives, which serve as a representation of your ultimate desires and establish the course for all of your endeavors.
          These bigger goals are broken down into mid-level objectives, which concentrate on important areas or benchmarks that will enable you to advance.
          Lastly, low-level goals—the practical, daily activities that propel you forward—support these.
          This methodical technique keeps goals reachable, motivation high, and focus consistent throughout the process.
        </p>

        <h3>Goal Status Overview</h3>
        <h4>Not Being Worked On</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing photography lighting techniques</li>
          <li>Improving overall fitness and health</li>
          <li>Establishing financial safety</li>
          <li>Practicing regular self-affirmations</li>
          <li>Managing unproductive habits</li>
          <li>Developing public speaking confidence</li>
          <li>Learning to seek help and balance independence</li>
          <li>Enhancing my personal appearance through fashion and style exploration</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Being Worked On and Not Yet Achieved</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Improving Adobe Lightroom editing skills</li>
          <li>Building consistency in daily habits</li>
          <li>Practicing discipline and time management</li>
          <li>Initiating mini website projects</li>
          <li>Designing and building my e-portfolio website</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Achieved</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Completed and led a photography photoshoot</li>
          <li>Successfully returned to school despite anxiety</li>
          <li>Participated in school volunteering events</li>
          <li>Adopted a habit of receiving and applying feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Slide 9: What Have I Noticed?</h2>
        <p>
          The majority of my objectives centre on personal development—enhancing self-discipline, boosting self-esteem, and honing creative abilities.
          I’ve noticed that I struggle the most with starting new goals, especially when they feel overwhelming.
          However, once I begin, I usually stick with them. For instance, completing a photo shoot and returning to school despite anxiety.
          I'm learning that small, consistent steps matter more than waiting for perfect conditions, and every bit of progress builds self-confidence.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 10: Influences That Helped Me Achieve My Goals</h2>
        <p>
          One important factor has been the support of friends, mentors, and school communities.
          Encouragement from others gives me the motivation to push forward.
          Structured settings—like school or guided modules—help keep me accountable and focused.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 11: Challenges That Affected My Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Personal challenges like anxiety, self-doubt, and perfectionism often slow my momentum.
          I also tend to lose discipline when I don’t see quick results.
          But by becoming more self-aware of these patterns, I’ve started to manage them more effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 12: Motivation & Focus</h2>
        <p>
          My motivation usually comes from wanting to grow and prove to myself that I’m capable.
          However, I sometimes lose focus when I feel overwhelmed or progress seems slow.
          Refocusing on my long-term goals helps realign my energy and perspective.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 13: Effort</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve consistently put in effort, especially in personal development and creative pursuits.
          I know I can still push harder in certain areas, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made from where I began.
        </p>

        <h2>Slide 14: My Current Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve my editing and photography skills</li>
          <li>Build healthy and consistent daily habits</li>
          <li>Enhance my personal style and presentation</li>
          <li>Strengthen time management and self-discipline</li>
          <li>Develop my e-portfolio and personal projects</li>
          <li>Practice mindfulness and manage anxiety</li>
          <li>Read one book per month for self-growth</li>
          <li>Take on leadership or volunteering opportunities</li>
          <li>Build better financial habits</li>
          <li>Explore and improve public speaking abilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Slide 15: Selected 5 Goals to Focus On</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Improve my editing and photography skills</li>
          <li>Build healthy and consistent daily habits</li>
          <li>Enhance my personal style and presentation</li>
          <li>Strengthen time management and self-discipline</li>
          <li>Develop my e-portfolio and personal projects</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Slide 24 & 28: Goal Breakdown Template</h2>
        <h3>Top-Level Goal</h3>
        <p>
          This goal is important to me because improving my editing and photography skills will help me express my creativity,
          enhance my personal projects, and open up professional opportunities in photography and visual content creation.
        </p>

        <h3>Mid-Level Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Take a Course on Photography and Editing – Complete a structured learning program to gain foundational knowledge.</li>

      <div class="tab-content" id="reflection-5">
        <h3>Consumer & Creator</h3>

        <p><strong>-> Are you a consumer, creator or both?</strong><br>
        I identify more as a consumer than a creator. I often find myself absorbing information and ideas from others instead of initiating and building my own personal projects.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you want to be a CONSUMER, constantly observing others and wondering how they got to where they are today? OR Do you prefer to be a CREATOR, someone who is unconcerned about what others may think and has decided that rather than just know something, you want to become known for knowing / doing something?</strong><br>
        Reflecting on the way I approach things, I want to strive to become a creator. I want to challenge myself to build projects from scratch and apply my knowledge in a more hands-on, purposeful way. I've spent too much time observing others, and it's time I stop caring about their opinions and start focusing on expressing my own potential.</p>

        <h3>Top Interests / Passions</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>I want to shift the content I consume towards fun facts and meaningful insights about the world and people, instead of mindless, repetitive content that doesn't serve me.</li>
          <li>I want to create more — especially by building up my photography portfolio.</li>
          <li>I want to design and develop my own dynamic, interactive website to showcase my work and personality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skills and Target Group</h3>

        <p>One area I struggle with is content creation, not because of lack of interest, but because I'm afraid of how others — especially strangers or certain people in my life — might perceive it.</p>
        <p>I'd like to build confidence in putting myself out there, starting with content that brings value to people like me.</p>
        <p>My ideal audience would be individuals who feel lost or lack direction, and are looking for small sparks of inspiration or simple joys to help them push forward in life.</p>

        <h3>Enjoyable Parts of Doing</h3>

        <p>I enjoy giving my best, especially when it involves breaking old habits and experimenting with new, more efficient approaches.</p>
        <p>I enjoy photography and web design because they allow me to create from scratch — to turn my vision into reality. It’s incredibly fulfilling when everything comes together cohesively and creatively.</p>

        <h3>Unpleasant Parts of Doing</h3>

        <p>The part I find unpleasant is how time-consuming the process can be. As a self-taught photographer and editor, I often struggle to find the right balance — especially in post-editing.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in web development, I lack experience in frameworks like Three.js, which are essential for creating truly dynamic websites. It takes time and a different kind of creative thinking to get used to new tools, and that learning curve can be intimidating at first.</p>

        <h3>Uncomfortable Situations</h3>

        <p>One uncomfortable situation involved giving presentations. There was a module that required weekly presentations, and I found it emotionally exhausting due to the anxiety I felt beforehand.</p>
        <p>However, it turned out to be a positive experience. Over time, I learned how to manage my stage fear by preparing thoroughly, focusing on the message I wanted to deliver, and embracing feedback. I now view presentations as an opportunity for growth rather than something to fear.</p>

        <h3>2a. Reflection on Learning – Grit Goals</h3>
        <p>
          In class, we learned about grit goals using the goal hierarchy model—a framework that breaks down long-term aspirations into manageable, actionable steps. At the top are <strong>core goals</strong>, driven by passion and purpose. These are supported by <strong>mid-level goals</strong>, which act as key milestones. At the foundation are <strong>low-level goals</strong>, consisting of daily or weekly tasks that keep momentum going.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach promotes clarity, persistence, and motivation. Unlike the traditional SMART goals I’ve previously used—which focus more on short-term completion—the grit goal hierarchy encourages consistency, resilience, and alignment with a bigger purpose. It turns large ambitions into smaller wins that are more achievable and sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this, I would often set isolated goals with no clear connection to a greater vision. When one goal failed, I’d lose direction entirely. Now, I understand that setbacks are part of the journey. By tying my smaller tasks to a meaningful top-level goal, I stay grounded and better motivated. This mindset shift has helped me view goal setting as a process of growth, not just outcome-based achievements.
        </p>

        <h3>2b. Reflection for Action – Personal Monitoring Plan</h3>
        <p>
          To stay focused on my grit goals, I plan to use a two-part monitoring approach: <strong>structured weekly tracking</strong> and <strong>accountability through reflection</strong>. These strategies will help me maintain clarity, measure progress, and stay adaptable.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Three personal limiting factors:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anxiety and self-doubt, which delay my ability to start tasks.</li>
          <li>Perfectionism, making it difficult to finish anything unless it feels “just right.”</li>
          <li>Discouragement due to lack of immediate results, leading to inconsistent effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Three personal success factors:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supportive mentors and peers who encourage and motivate me.</li>
          <li>Structured environments, such as school modules, that provide direction and deadlines.</li>
          <li>Self-awareness and feedback that help me reflect and adjust when facing obstacles.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Readjusted Grit Goals Using the Goal Hierarchy:</strong></p>

        <p><em>1. Original Goal: “Improve my editing and photography skills”</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Top-level goal:</strong> Become a skilled visual content creator.</li>
          <li><strong>Mid-level goal:</strong> Complete an online course and build a portfolio of work.</li>
          <li><strong>Low-level goal:</strong> Schedule two editing sessions per week and share one photo for feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>2. Original Goal: “Build healthy and consistent daily habits”</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Top-level goal:</strong> Maintain strong physical and mental well-being.</li>
          <li><strong>Mid-level goal:</strong> Develop a stable daily routine with adequate sleep and regular exercise.</li>
          <li><strong>Low-level goal:</strong> Plan meals weekly and track daily habits in a journal or habit tracker.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Monitoring Strategies to Stay on Track:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weekly Self-Check-ins:</strong> Reserve time every Sunday to review progress, identify challenges, and plan actionable tasks for the week ahead.</li>
          <li><strong>Accountability via Microsite or Peer Sharing:</strong> Regularly post progress on my microsite or check in with a peer to receive constructive feedback and stay motivated.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Lesson 06 Reflections -->
      <div class="tab-content" id="reflection-6">
        <h3>1. What are three to five values that describe/define you?</h3>
        <p>I see myself as resilient, curious, responsible, empathetic, and adaptable. Resilience means I don’t easily give up even when challenges pile up, like when debugging a stubborn piece of code that just won’t work. Curiosity drives me to explore beyond what’s taught in class — I’m always digging into new cybersecurity tools or hacking techniques. Responsibility shows in how I manage my time and commitments, especially balancing studies and personal projects. Empathy helps me understand team members’ struggles, which builds trust during group tasks. Adaptability allows me to shift gears quickly, especially when unexpected obstacles come up during assignments or when learning new software.</p>

        <h3>2. How do you think these values look like in action/behavior in your everyday life?</h3>
        <p>Resilience appears when I spend hours solving a coding bug without quitting or getting frustrated. Curiosity pushes me to attend webinars or read blogs beyond the syllabus. Responsibility is reflected in how I plan my study schedule meticulously and meet deadlines. Empathy shows when I listen patiently to a teammate’s concerns and offer help. Adaptability kicks in when I quickly switch to remote learning tools or adjust my project plan after feedback. These values aren’t just abstract ideas — they shape how I respond to real situations every day.</p>

        <h3>3. Recall a not-so-ideal incident that happened due to your behaviours in any of the following domains: Personal, Relationship, Academic / Career</h3>
        <p>During a group project, I once procrastinated and delayed sharing my part of the work. My perfectionism made me keep tweaking the design instead of sending a draft on time. This affected the whole team’s schedule and caused tension. The delay led to rushed final work, and the group felt stressed.</p>

        <h3>4. What were some of the values displayed?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, responsibility and communication values were weak in that moment. I let my perfectionism override the value of accountability, and I didn’t keep the team informed early enough. On the positive side, resilience showed as I worked late nights trying to fix the design, but it was too late to fully save the situation.</p>

        <h3>5. What were some of the behaviours portrayed?</h3>
        <p>Procrastination, avoidance, and poor communication were the main behaviors. Instead of sharing incremental progress or asking for help, I isolated myself and tried to “perfect” everything silently. This created a bottleneck.</p>

        <h3>6. What caused the resulting consequences?</h3>
        <p>The root cause was decision fatigue combined with fear of criticism. I kept second-guessing every choice and delayed sharing to avoid negative feedback. The team couldn’t adjust timelines effectively, causing stress and reduced trust.</p>

        <h3>7. If you are given a choice now, what will you do to change the consequence?</h3>
        <p>Now, I would break down the task into smaller chunks and set clear deadlines for myself. I’d communicate progress early, even if it’s rough, to get feedback and adjust quickly. Embracing imperfection early can save a lot of time and reduce stress for everyone.</p>

        <h3>8. Think of a time when you overcame a struggle to learn something.</h3>
        <p>I struggled with understanding subnetting in networking. At first, the concepts felt abstract and confusing. Every practice problem seemed to highlight gaps in my knowledge, which was frustrating.</p>

        <h3>9. Reflect on when you failed at first but kept trying.</h3>
        <p>Instead of giving up, I watched multiple tutorials, used subnet calculators, and practiced daily with small problems. My brain slowly connected the dots, and the confidence grew. I started visualizing networks as blocks rather than just numbers, which made the whole idea clearer.</p>

        <h3>10. Write a letter to a future student of your class about this struggle.</h3>
        <p>Dear Future Student,<br>
        Learning subnetting might feel like decoding an alien language at first — trust me, I’ve been there. Don’t be discouraged if you fail or feel lost; that’s part of the process. Break it down, practice regularly, and don’t hesitate to ask questions or find different resources. Your brain will adapt, and those confusing numbers will soon make sense. Perseverance is key, and the satisfaction when it clicks is worth every struggle. Keep going — you got this!</p>

        <h3>11. Give the future student advice on what to do when they encounter a learning obstacle.</h3>
        <p>When you hit a wall, pause and take a step back instead of forcing through frustration. Try a different approach or resource. Talk it out with peers or mentors, and practice consistently. Remember, setbacks are growth signals, not failures. Keep your mindset flexible and patient — progress often happens slowly but surely.</p>

        <h3>12. What is my goal?</h3>
        <p>My goal is to complete a cybersecurity Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge successfully within a month, improving my practical skills in vulnerability analysis and exploitation.</p>

        <h3>13. What are the values needed in order to reach the goal?</h3>
        <p>Perseverance to push through tough problems, curiosity to research unfamiliar exploits, responsibility to dedicate regular time, and humility to learn from mistakes.</p>

        <h3>14. How can these values help me in reaching my goal?</h3>
        <p>Perseverance ensures I don’t give up after initial failures. Curiosity fuels deeper understanding beyond surface-level tactics. Responsibility keeps me accountable to my study schedule. Humility allows me to accept feedback and keep improving without frustration.</p>

        <h3>15. What are the behaviours or actions I need to take to reach my goal?</h3>
        <p>Schedule daily study sessions, take detailed notes, join study groups for knowledge exchange, practice on beginner-friendly CTF platforms first, and reflect weekly on progress to adjust learning strategies.</p>

        <h3>16. Reflect and review on how I can adjust them to make it better.</h3>
        <p>If I find myself losing motivation, I can break study sessions into shorter, focused blocks to reduce burnout. I’ll also celebrate small wins to keep momentum. If a particular tactic isn’t working, I’ll seek alternate resources or mentors sooner instead of spinning wheels.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Lesson 07  Reflections -->
      <div class="tab-content" id="reflection-7">
        <h3>1. What are the common signs and symptoms of stress?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">S</span>tress shows up in many forms — sometimes it's loud, like anxiety attacks or snapping at someone, and sometimes it's subtle, like always feeling tired no matter how much I sleep. I personally experience mental fog, overthinking, and an overwhelming sense of "I can’t even start." Physical signs include headaches, tense shoulders, and fidgeting — my body reacts even before my brain realizes I’m under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big one for me is <strong>decision fatigue</strong> — when I’ve had too many things to process, I freeze on even the smallest choices. It’s not just being lazy; it’s like my brain buffer is full and I need to restart. In school or work, this makes even simple tasks feel impossible and leads to procrastination that spirals.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What are the possible causes of stress in your life?</h3>
        <p>
          Most of my stress comes from a mix of tight deadlines, overlapping responsibilities, and feeling like I have to meet everyone’s expectations. Group projects sometimes add to it, especially when roles aren’t clearly defined. I also stress myself out by trying to do things perfectly the first time — perfectionism and procrastination feed each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, even when I have time, I still feel stressed — that’s when I know it’s not about the workload, but about the mental pressure I place on myself to not fall behind or look incompetent.
        </p>

        <h3>3. How has stress affected the outcome of an activity or task you worked on before?</h3>
        <p>
          Stress makes my work worse when I let it pile up. I’ve turned in projects where I knew I could do better, but I ran out of emotional energy to care. On the flip side, sometimes a little pressure gives me focus — but there’s a fine line between helpful pressure and a total mental breakdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m stressed, I avoid things — emails, messages, tasks — until they snowball. It becomes harder to get back into the flow because I associate those things with guilt or fear of failing. That emotional buildup ruins the outcome more than the actual task itself.
        </p>

        <h3>4. What is eustress, and how can it be helpful?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">E</span>ustress is the good kind of stress — the one that energizes you instead of draining you. It’s like the adrenaline you get before a presentation or competition. Instead of panic, you feel challenged — and that challenge pushes you to perform at your best.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my life, <span class="italic">eustress</span> kicks in during hackathons, showcase prep, or solving real-world problems where there's pressure but also excitement. This kind of stress helps me focus better, stay engaged, and actually enjoy the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          In real life, eustress is what fuels growth. It’s that "this is hard, but I want to do it" feeling. Whether it’s learning a new skill, applying for internships, or presenting ideas to others — eustress helps me step out of my comfort zone while still feeling in control.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Identify a personal example where you experienced eustress.</h3>
        <p>
          One of the clearest examples of eustress for me was presenting during our final showcase. I was nervous, but I was also proud of what I built. That stress helped me rehearse better, dress up with confidence, and deliver my points with clarity. It felt good to be challenged — and even better to rise to the occasion.
        </p>

        <h3>6. What is neustress?</h3>
        <p>
          Neustress is a neutral type of stress. It’s information or situations that don’t directly affect me emotionally but still take up mental space. It’s not something I feel deeply — it’s more like mental background noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, reading about climate change statistics or seeing global layoffs in tech — these don’t affect me right now, but they still trigger quiet anxiety. They sit at the back of my mind like "What if?" thoughts that don’t need to be solved today but still weigh something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neustress reminds me how connected I am to the world — news, opinions, trends — they all enter my awareness and sometimes occupy space that I need for myself. It's not always harmful, but it can reduce my ability to focus on what matters now.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Identify an example in your personal life where you experienced neustress.</h3>
        <p>
          Recently, I came across articles about AI replacing cybersecurity jobs. While I’m not directly affected, it created this low-level stress — like I need to rush my learning or I’ll be irrelevant. It didn’t panic me, but it’s now a whisper I carry when I make career decisions. That’s neustress — not intense, but persistent.
        </p>

        <h3>8. What is distress and how does it affect the mind and body?</h3>
        <p>
          Distress is the harmful kind of stress — the one that drags you down instead of lifting you. It causes anxiety, exhaustion, and sometimes physical problems like stomach aches or insomnia. For me, distress leads to emotional shutdown — I stop communicating, stop showing up for myself or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long-term distress can make you lose motivation, even for things you care about. It’s not just "feeling tired" — it’s feeling hopeless or stuck in a loop you can’t escape. I’ve been there, especially during exam periods with personal life drama mixed in. The body holds onto that stress even when the crisis is over.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Identify a personal example of distress in your life. How did it affect you?</h3>
        <p>
          During one semester, I had family problems and school pressure at the same time. I remember feeling numb — I wasn’t crying or panicking, just zoning out. I barely ate, barely slept, and couldn’t concentrate on tasks I normally liked. I submitted assignments late not because I didn’t care, but because I was too mentally drained to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s what distress does — it doesn’t just affect performance, it changes how you feel about yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>10. What physical and mental reactions do you experience during acute stress?</h3>
        <p>
          When I’m under acute stress, my heart races, my hands feel cold, and I get that tight feeling in my chest. I can’t sit still and often start doing random tasks just to avoid the main one. Mentally, I overthink and catastrophize — imagining worst-case scenarios that rarely happen, but still scare me into inaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s like my body and brain go into survival mode. Logic shuts down, and emotion takes over.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Count your odd- and even-numbered responses. What do your results indicate?</h3>
        <p>
          (I would input my actual score here.) When I counted mine, I realized I had more physical responses than mental ones. That means my body carries stress more — I feel the weight in my shoulders, my gut, or my breathing before I can identify what’s bothering me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This explains why physical activities like walking or stretching help me more than just thinking it through.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Does this result surprise you? Why or why not?</h3>
        <p>
          It didn’t surprise me. I’ve always been the type to feel things in my body before my mind catches up. I can be in denial about stress mentally, but my body will call it out by making me tired, sore, or restless.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also made me realize that managing stress isn’t just about calming the mind — it’s also about releasing it from the body.
        </p>

        <h3>13. What do you currently do to manage your stress?</h3>
        <p>
          I listen to calming playlists, do light workouts, and use humor or memes to lift my mood. I also vent to close friends or write things down in a journal when I feel overwhelmed. Sometimes I just let myself crash, and that’s okay too — rest is a valid coping method.
        </p>

        <h3>14. Are your current coping methods effective? Why or why not?</h3>
        <p>
          They work in short bursts, but not always long-term. I notice that I still let things build up before I act. I want to be more proactive — like planning rest before I need it, not after I burn out. I’m learning that consistent self-care matters more than emergency self-care.
        </p>

        <h3>15. What are some new stress management strategies you'd like to try?</h3>
        <p>
          I’d like to try guided breathing apps and grounding techniques — something simple I can do on the spot. I’m also interested in mindful stretching or yoga for mental resets. Outside of activities, I want to set clearer boundaries — like saying no more often or turning off notifications when I need space to think.

        <h3>Lesson 08: Mindfulness Reflection</h3>

        <h4>Define what mindfulness means to you:</h4>
        <p><span class="indent">Mindfulness</span> is the intentional act of being fully present in the moment, with awareness of thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations, and surroundings — without judgment. It encourages us to live consciously, rather than on autopilot.</p>

        <h4>Describe your morning in a mindful and detailed way:</h4>
        <p>I woke up at 7:25 AM, slightly later than planned. The morning chirping of cuckoos and sunlight gently streamed into my room. The clouds outside resembled clusters of cotton wool. I scrolled Instagram for five minutes and saw a post from my favorite celebrity, which motivated me to start the day. I prepared hot water, washed my face and fringe, dried my hair, completed my skincare routine, got dressed, and packed my bag. It was a hot morning, so I brought along my portable fan. On the train, I was grateful for the cool air. I noticed a couple sitting nearby, but chose to close my eyes and rest. Upon arrival at school, I filled my bottle, mistakenly walked to the wrong building, then corrected myself and headed to the right classroom.</p>

        <h4>Why is mindfulness important in daily life?</h4>
        <p><span class="indent">Mindfulness</span> helps us stay grounded in the present. It reduces stress, improves emotional regulation, enhances concentration, and allows us to appreciate simple moments. In our fast-paced lives, mindfulness reconnects us to our inner clarity and peace.</p>

        <h4>List what you observe using your five senses:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> Trucks unloading with beeping sounds, rustling trees</li>
          <li><strong>Smell:</strong> The earthy scent of leaves</li>
          <li><strong>Sight:</strong> Leaves moving, butterflies fluttering</li>
          <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Neutral taste of saliva</li>
          <li><strong>Touch:</strong> The surface of a leaf</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Identify three things you have learned about mindfulness:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Mindfulness allows me to notice small details I would usually overlook.</li>
          <li>It teaches me to slow down and reflect before reacting.</li>
          <li>Being present helps me handle stress and improves decision-making.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How will you apply these lessons to your 3 domains?</h4>

      <!-- Lesson 07 CA Reflections -->
      <div class="tab-content" id="reflection-7-ca">
        <h3>3a. Reflection on Personal Values and Significance</h3>

        <h4>Define values and explain their significance to guiding one’s life to success:</h4>
        <p><span class="indent">Values</span> are fundamental beliefs or principles that shape our behavior and decisions. They serve as an internal compass, guiding individuals toward actions that align with their sense of purpose and ethics. Values influence personal success by promoting consistency, integrity, and resilience, which build trust and motivate sustained effort. On a broader level, values impact how we relate to others, shaping societal norms and contributing to community wellbeing.</p>

        <h4>Identify three personal values and describe them in actions and behaviours using the connections concept presented in class.</h4>
        <p>One core value I hold is <strong>integrity</strong>, demonstrated by my commitment to honesty and accountability in both academic work and teamwork. For instance, when faced with mistakes, I openly acknowledge them rather than hide errors, fostering trust with peers and mentors.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I value <strong>perseverance</strong>, reflected in my approach to challenges. I break down complex tasks into smaller steps and persist through difficulties without giving up, enabling steady progress in mastering cybersecurity skills.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, <strong>awareness</strong> guides how I observe and understand my own emotions and surroundings; this mindfulness helps me make thoughtful decisions and adapt effectively in both personal and professional situations.</p>

        <h4>Match the three personal values to personal goals.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Integrity</strong> aligns with my goal of establishing a reputable and ethical professional identity in cybersecurity.</li>
          <li><strong>Perseverance</strong> supports my aim to develop technical proficiency despite obstacles.</li>
          <li><strong>Awareness</strong> connects to my objective of maintaining emotional intelligence and responsiveness, improving teamwork and self-management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3b. Reflection for Action</h2>
        <h4>Examine two personal stressors and the underlying root causes.</h4>
        <p>Two major stressors I experience are <strong>overlapping deadlines</strong> and <strong>fear of underperforming</strong>. The root cause of time pressure is often poor planning and overcommitment, leading to anxiety as tasks pile up. Fear of underperforming stems from perfectionism, which fuels self-doubt and procrastination.</p>

        <h3>Identify three personal strategies to predict stressful situations in personal life.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Detailed scheduling</strong>: Visualizing deadlines to foresee busy periods.</li>
          <li><strong>Mindfulness practice</strong>: Noticing early signs of stress to intervene promptly.</li>

        <h3>Lesson 09: Personal Purpose and Values</h3>

        <h4>List your personal mission keywords and strengths:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consistency</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Discipline</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Authenticity</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Growth</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Balance</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Responsibility</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Describe the values and goals that guide your mission:</h4>
        <p>I strive to be consistent and disciplined in my actions — especially in submitting assignments on time and staying focused. I believe in studying hard and playing hard, while holding myself accountable without taking shortcuts. I aim to step out of my comfort zone socially and remain authentic in all interactions. These values support both my academic and personal growth.</p>

        <h4>Write a personal mission slogan:</h4>
        <p><strong>“To live authentically and consistently — showing up with discipline, courage, and heart. I aim to grow through hard work and stay true to who I am, both in success and struggle.”</strong></p>
      
      
          <h4>What is success to you in the next three years?</h4>
        <p>
          Success to me, in the next three years, means achieving personal and academic milestones. At the most basic level, it is graduating from polytechnic and completing my internship successfully, just like my peers. But more than that, success also means staying disciplined and consistent in my efforts—being able to follow through with my goals without giving up easily. It’s about becoming someone who is resilient, committed, and able to push through challenges.
        </p>

        <h4>Three goals to help me reach my definition of success:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Graduate and secure a job or further studies</strong><br>
            I aim to complete my diploma and either find a stable job in the cybersecurity industry or further my studies in a field I'm passionate about. This will be the foundation of my career journey.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Build quality social connections and improve communication</strong><br>
            I want to surround myself with people who support my growth, and at the same time, become more confident in social settings by improving my communication skills.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Stay consistent and disciplined in my personal goals</strong><br>
            Whether it’s working on my projects, building my portfolio, or practicing cybersecurity skills, I want to develop strong discipline and maintain momentum even when things get difficult.
          </li>
        </ol>
